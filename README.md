# Summary
  
  Tesla is one of my favorite company's and I promised myself I would buy a Model S someday. I visit the Tesla website often to keep up with any updates, but I'm always blown away by how beuetuiful the site is. I took it upon myslef to replicate the Tesla website only using REACT/Node.js and CSS. I also took the opportunity to work with YARN rather than NPM, which was easy to learn due to the fact that YARN can install any package from the npm registry.
